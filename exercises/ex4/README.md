# Exercise 4: Analyse the Data with Jupyter Notebook

## Description
In order to understand better the data you receive from the devices and develop more precise predictions on when devices fail, you like to offer data scientists the chance to access the data with Jupyter Notebook. 

## Exercise 

1. Go the **Launchpad** of SAP Data Intelligence and start the **ML Scenario Manager**. This is the data scientist environment to manage data, jupyter notbooks, models and pipelines. 
2. Create a new Scenario by clicking on the **Create** Button on the top left corner. ![Create Scenario](./images/createscenario.png) and name it \<user\_id\>\_QM_Analysis
3. In the **Scenario Details** page create a new pipeline in the section "Pipelines". ![Create Scenario](./images/createjn.png).
4. 


## Summary

You have learnt an alternative way to read and write to a HANA database as with the "Structured Data Operators" of the previous exercise. We used the "Validation Rule" operator to do simple data quality checks and finally how to use a python custom operator to leverage all the options provided by an advanced script.
