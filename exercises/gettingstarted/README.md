## Navigating around SAP Data Intelligence

In this workshop we will be working primarily with the **Modeler** application. The **Connection Manager** has been pre-configured with a HANA database connection as well as an Amazon S3 connection.

We will briefly use the **Metadata Explorer** application to browse these connections and preview some of the data we will be working with.
